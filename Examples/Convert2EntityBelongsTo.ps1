# 1 - Connect to your NSX Manager
# 2 - Run the script and it will report how many dynamic criteria are eligible
#     to convert to entity_belongs_to
#       ./Convert2EntityBelongsTo.ps1
# 3 - If your happy with what it wants to change, run the script with the 
#     -DoTheNeedful parameter
#       ./Convert2EntityBelongsTo.ps1 -DoTheNeedful
# 4 - Sit back, have a drink, and reflect on what you just did and how long it
#     would have taken you to do manually.

Often when NSX Security Groups are configured and some dynamic criteria rules
are created, it has been observed that security tag "equals" is often
configured. This is not an optimal configuration, and should be converted to use
entity_belongs_to. This script will automate the process.
